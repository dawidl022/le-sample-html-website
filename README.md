# Sample HTML Website

This is a sample website made as part of the
[Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial)
tutorial.

What I learnt:
- What is hotlinking and when it should be used vs when it shouldn't be used.
- To use `noopener` on `target="blank"` anchor tags and what security issues may
  arise if not conformed to.
